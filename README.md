# Slot
A web-based slot machine game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users spin reels with a "SPIN" button and stop them with "STOP" buttons, aiming for winning symbol combinations. Features include dynamic content generation and visual effects for wins.

This slot machine app is a simple web-based interactive game that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to emulate the experience of a traditional slot machine. Users can start the reels spinning with a "SPIN" button and stop them individually with "STOP" buttons. The dynamic generation of elements and event handling with JavaScript replicates the classic gameplay of slot machines.

The interface of the game is designed to have the reels spin and randomly align symbols based on user interaction. When certain combinations of symbols match up, visual feedback is provided through animations or additional graphics, such as those that might be displayed for a win scenario. At the bottom of the slot machine, there are images of a flower named "Hibiscus," which are presumably displayed with certain animations when winning combinations are hit.

This app can be used for learning web technologies, improving programming skills, or simply as a form of entertainment. It accommodates accessibility as players can control the game using keyboard arrow keys or on-screen buttons, ensuring ease of interaction for all users.
